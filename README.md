THIS IS NOT TO ENCOURAGE ANY FORM OF MALPRACTICE BUT TO ONLY SHOW THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE BROWSER AND HOW IT CAN BE IMPROVED. IF YOURE USING THIS YOURE PROBABLY A SHITHOLE (JUST AS I AM) AND IF YOU CANT UNDERSTAND, WELL IM SORRY 



How does it work?
  Running a safe browser on a VM (provided it does not detect vm) makes it so the lockdown browser only locks down the vm it is running on and not the host machine allowing anyone to pop out the vm's display 


Prereq
-Just a bit of time and patience
-A decently decent pc 


How?
Install your preferred virtual machine (rec - VMWARE and VIRTUALBOX)
install your choice of os to run (install a linux vm directly or install windows through an iso)
Setup the vm software and create a vm and allocate resources 
Open the vm/select the iso to install the os 

**IF LINUX**
Check what platform it is running on and try checking screen share (eg - https://demo.flashphoner.com/admin/login.html  NOT RECCOMENDING IT BUT JUST HERE SO GO AS YOU WISH)
If not then change platforms and try (**Google search**)
